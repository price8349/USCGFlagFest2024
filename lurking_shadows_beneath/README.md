# Lurking Shadows Beneath
As you can probably guess from the name **L**urking **S**hadows **B**eneath, this is an LSB (least significant bit) oracle attack.

An LSB oracle is a type of RSA chosen ciphertext attack that relies on a binary search algorithm to decrypt a plaintext message based on the last bit of an RSA decrypted message.

I am no cryptography expert, so I'll let my hackjobbed code speak for itself.
