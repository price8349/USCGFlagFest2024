This was also Hastad's Broadcast Attack, but most tools use e=3 with 3 messages instead of e=5 with 5 messages, so I had to hackjob a script that used e=5.

```
I will grant you your five wishes.
Length of flag: 15
WISH 1
...., 5, ....
WISH 2
...., 5, ....
WISH 3
...., 5, ....
WISH 4
...., 5, ....
WISH 5
...., 5, ....
```

My modified script is in `hastads-broadcast-attack.py`.
